description: "Embed code generator for GitHub Cards."
---

[Development Seed](https://developmentseed.org/) designed some [Github Cards](https://developmentseed.org/blog/2015/05/14/github-cards/). I thought it would be a fun little challenge to make an embed code generator for them.

Not sure how useful this is to anyone. It was just the end of an unproductive day of failed coding attempts and I wanted to prove to myself that I could actually do something. Do with it as you please. The embeded github card is hosted on Github Pages behind [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) so it should just work and handle traffic no problem. No servers here, it's just a static page and client-side code.
